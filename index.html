  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/ofrielb/euro2024" target="_blank">Predicting Euro 2024 Game Results</a>
      <p>Developed a custom implementation of decision trees and random forests to predict Euro 2024 match outcomes using team and player statistics. Combined this with scikit-learn models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost) for comparison, leveraging Pandas and NumPy for data processing and GridSearchCV for optimization. Visualized insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li><a href="https://github.com/ofrielb/the-knesset-Project" target="_blank">Predicting the Downfall of the 24th Israeli Government Using Network Science</a> 
      <p>Applied network analysis to forecast political instability in the 24th Knesset by analyzing member collaboration patterns. Built graphs with NetworkX and used community detection algorithms (Louvain, Girvan-Newman). Visualized political factions and collaboration trends with Gephi and Matplotlib.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li><a href="https://github.com/ofrielb/project3" target="_blank">Bayesian Network for Genetic Inheritance in Mice</a>
      <p>Designed a Bayesian network to model genetic inheritance and predict carrier probabilities for a recessive disease. Implemented sampling techniques (Gibbs sampling) using Python’s pgmpy library and performed probabilistic inference to assess disease risk across generations.</p>
